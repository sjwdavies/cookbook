## Ingredients

- 50 g onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 150 g roasted red peppers, from jar or freshly roasted
- 400 g chopped tomatoes, San Marzano or 5 fresh medium tomatoes
- 200 ml low-salt vegetable stock
- 100 g potato, peeled and diced
- 1 tsp olive oil or unsalted butter, optional, for sautéing

## Method

3. Select the smooth soup setting.
